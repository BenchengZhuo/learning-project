/*
@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

@Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

@EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath.
This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

@ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.
